# Java Code for Calculating the Average of Randomly Generated Ratings
This is a Java code for calculating the average of randomly generated ratings in a range from 1 to 6. The code contains two classes, Average and Main.

### Average Class
The Average class consists of an array of integers, a size, and three methods:

### Average(int n)
The constructor of the class which initializes the size of the array and generates random numbers in the range from 1 to 6. If the input size is not within the range of 1 to 20, it returns an error message.

### Calculate()
This method calculates the average of the numbers in the array by summing all the elements of the array and dividing by the size.

### Display()
This method displays the generated random numbers in the array.

### Main Class
The Main class contains the main method which creates two objects of the Average class and displays the randomly generated numbers and the calculated average. The first object is created with a size of 20 and the second one with a size of 5.

This code can be used to generate and calculate the average of randomly generated ratings.
